# SHACL shape repository

This repository provides SHACL shapes and shape groups. Its purpose is to be a place for collaboration to work on SHACL content together.

## Contributions welcome!

If you want to contribute, please follow the advice below.

* Use our [discovery service](https://schreckl.inspirito.de/) or browse this repository to see, that your shape is not already there.
* If **a shape already exists**, please consider improving existing one(s) instead of adding double/overlapping content.
* If **no shape is available**, fork this repository and create new folder in the **shape-groups** folder. Give it a short and meaningful name (e.g. adult-person). If unsure, look at existing folders. You have to split shape related information and meta data (void.ttl). Each group needs a `void.ttl` file containing related meta data, such as license. Afterwards create a pull request to let us know about it and to discuss your contribution.

## Develop and test shapes

There is a cool [web service](http://shacl.org/playground/) available, which helps a lot during creation of new shapes.
