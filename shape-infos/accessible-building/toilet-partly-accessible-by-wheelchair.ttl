# the following constraints describe a building, which has a toilet which is partly accessible by wheelchairs.

# a toilet is partly accessible by wheelchairs, if:
# - door width: >= 70 cm
# - available space left or right of WC: >= 70 cm
# - available space in front of the WC (width + length): >= 100 cm x 100 cm
# - at least left or right support handle is foldable
